The entry viewer has been updated to automatically mark the current entry as read. The current entry can be marked as unread using the old *pin* action. Pinned entries are kept as unread until you manually mark them as *done*.

The swipe gesture on the entry list has also been updated to *pin* and *unpin* entries.

With this release the preview app has enough features to be called a news reader, but this doesn't mean it's done. I will start working on the *mysterious* Tags tab.
