Feeds with update errors are highlighted by the warning icon now. Expanding such a feed will show you the last update error message and how many consecutive errors occurred.

In case of an error, Aggregator will first retry in 15 minutes. If the error occurs again, Aggregator will increase the delay with each new scheduled retry, up to one week.

Additionally, Aggregator now uses special HTTP headers that help reduce network traffic, when feed publishers support them.

**What's next?**

I'll start working on the entry viewer.
