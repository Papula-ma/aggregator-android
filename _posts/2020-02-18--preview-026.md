I'm not really done with this new feature but it took so long to come at this stage that I simply had to share it with you...

So here is what changed:

* the feed tags have been converted to entry tag rules
* a predefined _Pinned_ tag has been added to allow pinning entries via rules

What still needs to be done:

* ask the user if the already aggregated entries should be re-tagged using the new or updated rule, or if a rule should be applied only on new entries... currently the first action is taken
* the rule editor has a condition option... it's just a placeholder for now... I still need to decide on how users should edit the condition (I'm open for suggestions)
