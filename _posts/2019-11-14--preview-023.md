This version improves the way the entries list is loaded... and fixes some bugs in the entry viewer.

Additionally... The unread count from the old app is back.

And when you return from the entry viewer, the list will be scrolled to the last read entry.

The share option from the entry viewer has been implemented too.

One of the missing features is **notifications**. Do you have some improvement suggestions over what the old app already does? Now's the time to talk about them... since this is my new target.
