This version doesn't bring any new features.

I had to take a break and fix some reported bugs, crashes and known issues.

Hopefully I didn't add too many new bugs, since some components had to be drastically re-engineered.

Some of the improvements include:
- Update the feed parser to respect the title type (see [this post](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/xml-title-xml-entity-html.html))
- Re-implement the "drop-drown-button" so it doesn't get automatically clicked on screen rotation
- Report more error types while parsing a feed
- Make the favicon update connectivity-aware
