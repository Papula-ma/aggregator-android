What changed?
- App version is present in the navigation drawer
- The favicon background has been removed
- The "unsubscribe" option was moved to the feed settings and the "update" option took its place
- Show scheduled update in the expanded feed
- Calculate next update based on the aggregated feed entries (doesn't trigger an update yet)
- Fixed some reported errors

What's next?

It's time to take care of feed updates:

- Make update mode editable
- Update feeds in the background
