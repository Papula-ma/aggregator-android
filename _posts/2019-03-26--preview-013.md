This took a while... 40 days and 97 git commits.

While adding support for tags, I realized that the used persistence library is not flexible enough for my needs and had to be replaced. Not an easy task, since nearly every app corner made use of it.

What brings this preview, besides a reworked persistence layer?
- support for starring entries, from the entry viewer
- the *Tags* tab has finally some content: it can be used to list, add, rename and delete tags
- the *Starred* tag cannot be deleted, since it is used by the starring feature... users can rename it though
- clicking on a tag will open the list of tagged entries

Please note that you cannot tag entries with your own tags yet. This will come in the next preview.
