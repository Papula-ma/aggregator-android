### Important changes:

* Add support for entry tag rule conditions
* Store new feed entries only if their age matches the configured _cleanup mode_ 
* Treat UTF-16 as UTF-16LE if the [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) is missing

### Rule condition examples:

- `title contains "Corona" or title contains "corona"`
- `( title starts with "This " ) and ( title ends with "!" )`
- `content contains "COVID-19"`
- `link is "https://github.com/tughi/aggregator-tughi"`
