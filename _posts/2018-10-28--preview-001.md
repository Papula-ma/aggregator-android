- Entries are now grouped by date, like in the old app
- Opening an entry marks it as read
- Added swipe gesture to toggle between read and unread
- The feed list shows the number of unread entries
- The app remembers the selected theme

Please note that the preview app will delete the added feeds if the new version has a new database schema. It makes no sense to migrate the database at this point. 

What's next?

I'll work on the feed list and add a way to unsubscribe from feeds.
