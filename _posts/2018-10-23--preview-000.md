**Aggregator Next** is now available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tughi.aggregator.next)

This preview is far from a usable news reader, but far enough to get a feeling where Aggregator is heading to.

What does this first version do?
- subscribe to feeds either by entering a feed or website URL, or directly from the browser via the share option
- the **feeds** tab shows all feeds to which you subscribed
- clicking on the feed will show its entries
- the **my feed** tab shows the entries from all your feeds
- clicking on an entry will open it in your web browser
- feeds are currently updated only on app launch, and the **feeds** tab shows the last successful update time
- the application remembers your last visited tab
- there two themes light and dark that can be selected from the the navigation drawer

What am I working on next?

Add basic features the entry list:

- show dates
- mark entry as read when opened
- option to toggle read state
