The "unexpected scrolling up" issue was caused by a paging component still being in alpha. I removed it and now everything works fine but large sets of entries will not load a fast as before. I'll wait until the component becomes stable and try it again.

Besides fixing the issue I:

- optimized the entry list scrolling speed
- included the authors on the entry lists
- added support for favicons
