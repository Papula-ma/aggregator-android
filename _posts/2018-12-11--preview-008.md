I added more update modes:
- **on application launch** - to update such feeds when the app is launched
- some **repeating** variants - to update such feeds every 15, 30 or 45 minutes or every 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 hours, similar to the old app

The "Find feeds" supports now OPML file loading. The "load OPML file" button will open Android's File Manager which allows you to pick a file from the local storage or from other sources, like Dropbox and Google Drive, depending on what compatible app you have already installed.

**What's next?**

The preview app doesn't handle feed update errors... so this is what I'll do next: 

- show update errors
- add back-off strategy when scheduling update retries
