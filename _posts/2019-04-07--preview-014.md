This release is all about tags...

You can tag entries now manually from the embedded viewer, or automatically by tagging the feed itself. The tag list shows now the *total entries* count and the *unread entries* count in the expanded view. And tags can be created directly from the tagging screen.

What's next?

Currently *My Feed* shows entries from all feeds. This will not be the only option in the future...
