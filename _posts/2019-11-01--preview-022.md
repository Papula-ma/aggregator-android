I have quite a few feeds on my Android phone and with time I noticed that loading the entries (currently a little under 26000) got very slow. The reason for this was that the app loaded all entries into memory... until now.

Starting with this version, Aggregator loads only the entries that are visible or about to get visible depending on the scroll direction. This change improves the initial loading time and reduces the memory usage.

I also found the time to add support for entry links that have a [fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier).
