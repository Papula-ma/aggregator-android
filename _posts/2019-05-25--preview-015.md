At last, my vision for **My feed** is on its feet!

From now on, **My feed** can be configured to show only what's important, by selecting a set of tags that should be included. This way, important entries (like local news) can be separated from the rest and accessed quicker.

I hope you like this feature too...

To still get a list of all entries, the new **All** predefined tag has been introduced on the **Tags** tab.

Please give this new feature a try and don't hesitate to share your thoughts about it.
