You get a notification when new entries have been added to **My Feed**. This feature can be toggled in the settings screen.

As notification icon, I'm using the **core** of the launcher icon, which has been tweaked a bit again to have a better weight when the **gear** is missing.

With this release I also crushed a bug that crashed the app when one tried to subscribe to a feed that doesn't have a link, like a YouTube channel feed.
