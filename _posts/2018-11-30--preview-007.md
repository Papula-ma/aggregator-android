Starting with this version you can change the update modes. I also renamed the **auto** update mode to **adaptive**..
. 
Available update mode:

- **adaptive** - calculates the next update based on the aggregated entries
- **default** - a configurable mode that get's applied to all feeds using it
- **disabled** - no auto update

Next, I'll be adding two more update modes and OPML support.
