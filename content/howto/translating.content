Looking at Google's statistic, I thought that there might be some users out there that would
like to contribute by translating the app. So I set up a [website](https://weblate.tughi.com)
that would allow just that.

In the past days I looked at more self-hostable solutions and decided to go on with [Weblate](
https://weblate.org). In this post I am not going to explain how to use Weblate since this is
alreay covered by their [documentation](https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-2.12/user/translating.html)
, but go briefly over what means to translate Aggregator.

### Authentication

Registration is open. You only need a Google account to be able to sign in.

This account will be used for e-mail notifications, if enabled.

### Initial configuration

On your first login, please go to the [profile page](https://weblate.tughi.com/accounts/profile/#account)
and set the `Full name`. The username and the full name is the only information visible to other
translators. You can configure both of them.

Next, please go to [Languages](https://weblate.tughi.com/accounts/profile/#languages) and select
your language(s) in the `Translated languages` field.

Now move to [Subscriptions](https://weblate.tughi.com/accounts/profile/#subscriptions) and select
**Aggregator** as a `watched project`.

By completing these two steps, the Weblate dashboard will give you direct links to the languages
you can translate.

To stay informed about `new strings to translate`, `new suggestions` or `new comments` activate
them in the subscription settings (this section is not visible in the mobile version of the website).

### The translation process

Translators are able to suggest new translations or vote suggestions from other translators. A
suggestion is applied as soon as it receives **3** votes.

If some strings cannot be translated just by looking at the string and context, please add a
comment and I'll try to give more details.

Strings can contain special markers like `%1$s` or `%2$d`. Please keep them in the translated
text. They are required at runtime when the final text is generated.

Only the languages that are over 90% completed are added to Aggregator. Gowing below this
percentage means removal too.

Currently, there are 164 strings (totaling 433 words) used in different parts of the app.
Not that many... Right?
